# Brendan
 This bot is a mixed bag of things and was the first bot I ever wrote, followed by the Youtube bot in this folder. This would replace messages @ing brendan and remove anyone from the AKF voice channel if they weren't me.

## Brendan
 This bot has no commands, it just listens to the 'getting-brendans-attention' channel and the 'Austins Home' voice channel.

## Youtube
 This bot started as a way for us to get near instant discord notifications when Binging With Babish would upload a video and then evolved to the ability to subscribe to other youtube channels
