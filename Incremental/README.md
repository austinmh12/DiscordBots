# Incremental
 This bot started as a way to make and play an incremental/idle game in discord, and while I know there are other games out there like the Tap Titans discord one, games like Fortnite wouldn't have existed without PUBG. Besides, 95% of these bots are for learning purposes.

 This bot never got much attention because after creating it, I immediately started working on the DnDxMTG and the PokeRoulette bots.
