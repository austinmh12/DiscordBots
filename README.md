# DiscordBots
 A repository for all my Discord bots. Each bot has a more in-depth description of it and it's commands in its folder. Each folder contains (generally) a bot, and AustinBot contains all of the bots as cogs that can be registered to a guild.

 Each bot's README will be split into cogs and each section will have a command list, and then a detailed list of the commands. Each command will have a **usage:** in it which uses the following notation:
 `.command <required argument> (optional argument (default value))`

## Anime
 A discord bot that went through registered subreddits and downloaded images and uploaded them to discord, splitting them between SFW and NSFW channels. 

### Mudae
 In the Anime bot folder there are two bots, the above, and then Mudae. Mudae started as a bot to supplement the actual MudaeBot which is way more robust, but then it evolved to hold the Pokemon game, and host a local Minecraft server.

## DnD
 Started as a bot to play DND in discord. Useful, but dropped development when I found out about roll20.

## DnDxMTG
 A bot that fetches MTG cards from the gatherer and displays them in discord. Was built to be used in conjunction with me and a buddy of mine's homebrew dnd campaign that used an amalgamation of MTG and DND5e combat in place of the base 5e combat.

## Incremental
 An incremental game in discord. Never actually did anything on this because I didn't have enough knowledge with discord bots at the time.

## Brendan
 A discord bot for my small group of friend's discord. Named after the person it was built to annoy, it also encompassed a youtube subscribtion function that would allow users to subscribe to youtube channels since YouTube's notifications aren't always the best. The first bot I made, and is very crude, but it did it's job.

## TestBot
 This is a bot that I use to test everything in my personal bot testing server. At the moment it serves as a test bed for the PokeRoulette game, but soon it'll be a monopoly bot.
